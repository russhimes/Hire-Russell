# This virtual resume was set up to show the value I can bring to a development team.  

The About Page features a slideshow created using Javascript, while the formatting is done with a CSS stylesheet and bootstrap dynamic sizing.  This page is intended to be versatile enough to be useable on any screen size.  

The page is currently set up as a PHP web app through Microsoft Azure, though it may be migrated to Github pages in the coming weeks.

## ToDo:

I have been adding to this site periodically as I work my way through TechElevator's 14-week Java bootcamp.  Ultimately, I'd like to run some of my projects through this web app's project page, providing employers with a one-stop shop to see my best work.
